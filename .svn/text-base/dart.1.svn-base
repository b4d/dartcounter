.SH NAME
dart - Application for counting points in various dart games.


.SH SYNOPSIS .B catapp [\-option ...]

.SH DESCRIPTION .PP \fIcatapp\fP is a complete application that 
does nothing useful.

.PP It was written for demonstration purposes for http://www.linux.com

.SH OPTIONS .PP It doesn't have any, but let's pretend, to make 
this template complete:

.TP .BI \-option If there was an option, it would not be -option.

.SH RESOURCES .PP catapp uses almost no resources.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS The program should provide an approximate position 
where the cat ought to be found. The return value is in terms 
of time, distance and direction.

.SH SEE ALSO The only other program we know with this little 
functionality is the ubiquitous hello world application.
